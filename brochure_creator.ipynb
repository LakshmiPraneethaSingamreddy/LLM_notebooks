      "\n",
      "✅ Every Gradio app already ships with a programmatic API. Add `mcp_server=True` to your launch, and your app instantly becomes a tool that any AI agent can discover and use via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). No new stack to learn. No separate integration to build. Just one flag.\n",
      "\n",
      "✳️ Now multiply that by the hundreds of thousands of Gradio-powered Spaces on Hugging Face — image generators, translation models, speech recognition, code assistants — and you start to see the picture. Not a demo library. A latent ecosystem of agent-ready tools.\n",
